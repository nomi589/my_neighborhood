# My Neighborhood

This project features a map of a neighborhood with at least 5 highlighted locations. The highlighted locations are each displayed with a marker on the map. Clicking on any of the markers initiates an API request to get additional information about that specific location.

Additionally a 'Filter' component is provided which can be used to filter the locations displayed on the map. Clicking on any of the locations in the filter component also displays the same additional information about that location.

The additional information about a location is displayed by using the Wikipedia API.
